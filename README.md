Create React application
Inside your application create your components according to use case.
For data you can create simple json file [Example data.json] in your application as per use case and import json file instead of Axios call.
Update the set then use for operation. [for data as of now you can collect some fake data in json file as per use case].
For look and Feel example applying css work after completing functional activities. 
I suggest try to make an application with adding Header, Footer and display the content in body of page with applying css.
